* Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

I have an analytical mind and liked math in college.  I believe I have aptitude for programming. When I studied in college in Russia I took an introductory short programming course. That course was so long ago that our computer took an entire room. The only thing I remember from that course is that out of 35 kids in my group I along with four other students were excused from writing a final exam due to straight A's in class.  

I love technology. I am fascinated to see where technology is going. I remember how life was in the eighties and how far we came in 30 years. I would like to be not just a spectator, but also a contributor to this process. Since we make ourselves depend on computers and machines in almost every aspect of our lives, programming is used most everywhere.  

I briefly tried learning JavaScript on my own and enjoyed it. However I found it hard to stay motivated without a support system.  Having Ada Developers Academy locally is an amazing opportunity not only learn the craft, but also participate in the gender-diversity, since IT is still male dominated field.


* What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?

I would like to take advantage of ADA developers program and enter the IT field. Learning what aspect of programming would be most interesting to me would be first priority. Second is getting certification in the chosen field. In two years I will be able to write code and be able to work on projects independently and within a team, achieving full financial independence. I would strive to learn as much as I can trying to advance in the field. In five years I would like to be employed as a software developer in a startup, seeing a project growing from an idea to a successful enterprise. Since they are my goals, and I would like to dream big :), being the startup idea's generator is not out of the question either!


* Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?
A recent mistake I learned a lot from was relying on my spouse to be a sole breadwinner in the family. After a company he has been working for had layoffs and he was let go, I realized that I need a backup plan and as a family we need a second income. I used to work, enjoyed it and was financially independent, alas it was in the last century. Now I need to go back to school to have work skills that are relevant for today's economy and job market. Hence, my application to Ada.  Ada or not, working toward gainful employment is my goal. Thus, I am working on eliminating a chance of ever being in this situation again.
 

* Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.

I taught myself English language. When I immigrated I hardly knew 100 words of English. I was determined to learn as fast as possible. I went to the library and got my favorite English fiction books by Alistair MacLean and Somerset Maugham that I read in Russian translation. Since I loved the books and knew the plot well it was easier to understand what is going on even with very limited vocabulary. I had notebooks and dictionary handy and wrote down words and whole sentences, if needed and their translation. Then I spend time memorizing them.  I would take my English dictionary everywhere I go and even watched TV with it and a notebook in hand.  After six months of hard work my English improved considerably and I was able to find a bookkeeper's job in a restaurant.
